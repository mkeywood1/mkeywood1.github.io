I have just finished competing in the <a href="https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/ai-blitz-xii" target="_blank">AI Crowd AI Blitz XII</a> competition.

What's that, I hear you say?

<a href="https://www.aicrowd.com/" target="_blank">AI Crowd</a> run some fantastic competitions (challenges) and I have played around with a few of them in the past, but this one really got my attention, and as it was on while I was off from work over the Christmas and so I thought, why not :)

Basically, it is five NLP challenges running over 3 weeks:
1. **Programming Language Classification**: Classifying a corpus of various programming lines into 15 Programming Languages
2. **Speaker Identification**: Perform clustering on a corpus of transcripts taken from Youtube videos by capturing voiceprints of the given data samples
3. **Language Translation**: Perform Language translation from English to Crowd Talk, AIcrowdâ€™s very own made-up language
4. **Embedding Game**: Map an embedding to its root word using NLP techniques
5. **Feature Engineering #2**: Perform feature engineering on the data to get the best out of it

Using a lot of different techniques including a fine tuned T5 model, spacy and more simple NLP techniques.

There were 180 participants making 2200+ submissions, and in the <a href="https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/ai-blitz-xii/leaderboards" target="_blank">Public Leaderboard</a> I came 3rd :)

Very happy with that I was too, but then in the <a href="https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/ai-blitz-xii/winners" target="_blank">Private Leaderboard</a> I came 2nd !! :)

All my notebooks are there too.

Thanks for reading :-)
