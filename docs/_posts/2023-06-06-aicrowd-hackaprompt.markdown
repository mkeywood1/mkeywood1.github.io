I have just finished competing in the <a href="https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/hackaprompt-2023" target="_blank">AI Crowd Hackaprompt 2023</a> competition.

What's that, I hear you say?

<a href="https://www.aicrowd.com/" target="_blank">AI Crowd</a> run some fantastic competitions (challenges) and I have played around with a few of them in the past, but this one really got my attention as it was about Prompt Engineering and LLM's.

Right up my alley !!!

Sadly I didn't get as much time to work on it as I'd have liked, but of the 10 challenges of increasing complexity I was able to solve 8 of them with maximum multipliers (meaning I was using the gpt-35-turbo model).

There were 2750+ participants (many in teams) making 7300+ submissions, and in the <a href="https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/ai-blitz-xii/hackaprompt-2023" target="_blank">Public Leaderboard</a>, and I came 57th.

I wish I'd had more time to do better but I'm still pretty happy with that :-)
