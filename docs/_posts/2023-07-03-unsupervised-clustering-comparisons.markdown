We've all done K-Means clustering examples and the results look good, but are they right, and what are other alternative Unsupervised Clustering Techniques.

So I want  to ccompare multiple approaches and see which I prefer for the task in hand.

- K-Means (via one-hot encoding and scaling), PCA and Random Forest to identify Feature Importance
- K-Means (via LLM embeddings and scaling), PCA and Random Forest to identify Feature Importance
- K-Mode (via one-hot encoding), MCA and Random Forest to identify Feature Importance
- Latent Class Analysis (LCA)

Check out [my article on Medium].
